<h2>The scanner</h2>
Part of our code is adding something called a scanner. There are several functions 
which control the scanner, some of which I'll list here. You might want to think 
of the scanner as a small creature which has been set loose on top of borer, or within 
borer, to explore the program and execute code in different parts of the program. <br>
<br>
In this example, the scanner is the blue square. You will see them start up in the top 
left corner. Because the body of our borer is a circular array, and we move the scanners in the <b>+</b> and <b>-</b> direction, some scanners move to the end of the body first. We add about 10 of these 
scanners, and they slowly age until they die (age 90). It's possible this is your first 
introduction to bio-programming, however basic, and we've created a little artificial life-form. It's nice to think of it this way, as we progress the program.

<h2>Creating the scanner</h2>
Here we add a single instance <b>scanb</b> (scanner begin) which carries all the scanners, and we do this once.
<div style="width:100%;">
<div>
<div style="padding:15px; margin:15px; background:#cacaca">
codex.push (<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;function scanb( borer ) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if ( borer.scanners )<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return; // one instance<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;borer.scanners = new bexScanners();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
);<br>
</div>
</div>
</div>

and then we add <b>scanm</b> (scanner make). Note we only want 5 scanners active for now!
<div style="width:100%;">
<div>
<div style="padding:15px; margin:15px; background:#cacaca">
codex.push (<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;function scanm( borer ) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if ( !borer.scanners )<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if ( borer.scanners.length() > 10 )<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var scanner = new bexScanner();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;borer.scanners.add( scanner );<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
);
</div>
</div>
</div>


<h2>Motion</h2>
Once we have our scanners being created, we need to add motion to them. Since they sit 
on top of the borer's body, we can use that index and move them up and down. 
<div style="width:100%;">
<div>
<div style="padding:15px; margin:15px; background:#cacaca">
codex.push ( <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;function scani( borer ) { <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if ( !borer.scanners ) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return 0; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var i = borer.scanners.at();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var range = borer.body.length;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if ( i )<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;borer.scanners.move( i, range );<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;} <br>
);
</div>
</div>
</div>
Note that we keep the scanner within the range of the body. There is never a situation 
where the scanner moves from the body of the borer, that is, it <i>belongs</i> to the 
borer. We might allow it to in a future version, but where does it go? That's a good 
question.<br>
<br>
We can also move our scanner to the current position of the white square. The <b>pos</b> 
executes each unit of the body of the borer once each pass, so we can 
use it to lift the scanner and reposition it there.

<div style="width:100%; padding:15px; margin:15px; background:#cacaca">
codex.push (<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;function scanp( borer ) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if ( !borer.scanners )<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var cursed = borer.scanners.cursed();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if ( cursed )<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cursed.pos = borer.pos;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
);<br>
</div>

<h2>Passing execution to the scanner</h2>
Lastly, we want the currently cursed scanner to be able to execute functions it finds. This only happens when the borer <b>pos</b> hits the <b>scane</b> function. 

<div style="width:100%; padding:15px; margin:15px; background:#cacaca">
codex.push (<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;function scane( borer ) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if ( borer.executing )<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;borer.executing = 1;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if ( !borer.scanners )<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var cursed = borer.scanners.cursed();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var pos = cursed.pos;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var code = borer.body[ pos ];<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var f = borer.codex[ code ];<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if ( f ) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f( borer );<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;borer.executing = 0;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
);
</div>
Here we mark the borer as executing to prevent chain execution, which causes an error. 
We could in practice allow some chain execution, but we'll learn to control it in a 
later tutorial. That's it!
